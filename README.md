# Java-Text-Game

Java Functionality Testing

## Getting Started

### Installing

* To test this for yourself you must have an up-to-date [Java/JDK](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) installed on your system
* This works on any terminal of your choosing, but for the best experience I recommend using [Git.Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Executing program

* Clone this repository to the desired location
* Open your terminal
* Navigate to the saved location using ```cd folderName``` command, where *folderName* is the name of your path folder
* When in right location run:
```
javac MedievalGameDriver.java

java MedievalGameDriver
```
to compile and execute the program
